Discord Bot - used to parse loot
The game doesn't offer website with items/monster database
so i came up an idea to create bot to analyst loot log which is in game after killed monster
You just only have to copy everything from lootlog window and paste it on pastebin.com
and then paste link to Discord with running bot,
or u can run project from windows without using discord
